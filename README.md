# O-shortener Overview

The O-shortener is a URL shortening application that converts long URLs into manageable links that wonâ€™t break in email postings.

## Technologies Used
- NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.
- MySQL, a relational database management system.
- Prisma, an open-source database ORM (Object-relational mapping).
- TypeScript, a strongly typed superset of JavaScript.
- Jest, a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

## API Endpoints
- `POST /auth/signup`: Register a new user.
- `GET /:short_code`: Redirect to the original URL associated with the given short code.
