# O-shortener Testing Guide

Welcome to the O-shortener repository. This project is a URL shortening service built with TypeScript and the NestJS framework. As part of our commitment to quality, we have a robust suite of tests that help ensure the correctness of our code.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the tests using `npm run test`. This will execute all the unit tests in the project.

## Test Structure

The tests are organized according to the structure of the application. Each module (like `auth` and `urls`) has its own `spec` files that contain the tests for that module. For example, the `auth.controller.spec.ts` file contains tests for the `AuthController`, and `auth.service.spec.ts` contains tests for the `AuthService`. 

Tests for guards, like `AuthGuard`, are also available and can be found in their corresponding files like `auth.guard.spec.ts`.

## Writing Tests

When writing tests, we use the `describe` and `it` syntax from Jest, which is the testing framework we use. `describe` is used to group related tests, and `it` is used to define a single test case. 

When you need to add a new test, follow the structure of the existing tests. Create a `describe` block for the function you're testing, and add `it` blocks for each specific behavior you want to test.

To test a service or a controller, you need to create a NestJS testing module in the `beforeEach` block and get an instance of the service or controller from the testing module.

Remember to always assert the expected behavior in your test. For example, if a function is expected to return a certain value, make sure your test asserts that the function does indeed return that value.

## Improving Tests

To make improvements to the tests, look for areas where the current tests might be lacking. This could be a function that isn't fully tested, a behavior that is tested but not clearly, or a complex function whose tests could be broken down into smaller, more specific tests.

Make sure your improvements follow the existing test structure, and remember to run the tests to make sure they pass after making your changes.

## Conclusion

We hope this guide is helpful as you work with the tests in this project. If you have any questions or run into any issues, feel free to reach out to the team.
